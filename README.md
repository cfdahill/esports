Blizzpicks is a site that will let the user choose who they think will be the champion of an esports match.  It can currently be viewed at https://blizzpicks.com.  There were some challenges to getting a functioning database on Heroku so it currently does not have any database functions such as storing users' picks.  The grayed out features in the navbar are features that are not yet implemented.  It is a proof of concept  that I will be continuing to work on in my spare time.


# MERN STARTER

This is a MERN skeleton that connects a Node.js (Express )back-end with a React.js (create-react-app) front-end.

To use: 

 1. Fork and/or clone repository
 2. Change remote: ``git remote set-url origin git://new.url.here``
 3. cd into folder
 4. ``yarn start`` will run both front-end and back-end
 5. Happy coding

Feel free to request any features, but I'd like to keep it as bare-bones as possible.
